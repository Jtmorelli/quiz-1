"""
- Craete a program that will read the contents of the file 'weapons.txt'. Each record in the file represents the specs to a weapon.
- Create an instance of the weapon object for each record. 
- Create a dictionary that will contain the name of the weapon as the key and the number of bullets as the value. 
- Print out details of each weapon using the object's methods only (as per comments below). 
- Fire all bullets of the weapon and print a countdown of bullets remaining (run exe file to visualize, 
HINT: use end='\r' in your print statement).
- Print out the name of the weapon and the number of bullets from the dictionary.

HINT: Follow the comments for each line to help with the logic of the problem.
